1. Essentially, JMeter assesses how well the application performs under stress, while IntelliJ Profiler identifies and diagnoses inefficiencies at a code level.
2. Profiling helps by closely examining how your application runs, showing where it's slow or uses too much memory, so you can find and fix those specific problems.
3. Yes, IntelliJ Profiler is effective because it provides detailed insights into how your application's code behaves in real-time, like showing which parts are slow or use a lot of memory.
This makes it easier to spot and fix the exact parts of your code that are causing problems.
4. One main challenge in performance testing and profiling is accurately simulating real-world usage and interpreting complex data, which is overcome by carefully planning test scenarios and using tools
that simplify data analysis.
5. Using IntelliJ Profiler for profiling your application code provides clear insights into performance issues, such as memory leaks or slow execution, enabling targeted and efficient optimization of your code.
6. In such situations, I cross-reference the results, considering different testing environments and scenarios, to identify the root cause of discrepancies and adjust my approach for a more comprehensive
understanding of the performance issues.
7. After analyzing performance testing and profiling results, I prioritize optimizing the most resource-intensive parts of the code, like improving algorithms or reducing memory usage.
   To ensure these changes don't affect the application's functionality, I will test the updated code using automated and manual tests to check for any unexpected issues.
